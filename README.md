## Week 1

URL to instance running api:
- Daniel's - [http://ec2-34-227-161-151.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/status](http://ec2-34-227-161-151.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/status) (this one has been terminated)
- Einar's - [http://ec2-52-207-255-176.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/status](http://ec2-52-207-255-176.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/status)

We are both running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, we have not gotten the chance to test everything on Mac OSX. Everything has worked flawlessly on our machines so far, but the only concerns are minor things like verify_environments.sh, some commands may be different on Macs!

## Week 2

Jenkins instance: [http://ec2-18-234-243-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080](http://ec2-18-234-243-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080)

While working on the project we did not focus too much on branching, as we believe that at this set-up stage, before having the Deploy job on Jenkins that it was not too necessary. Going onwards we plan to branch to a development branch.
