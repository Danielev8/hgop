# About Us

## Daníel Ekaphan Valberg

I was born in Iceland but most of my life I grew up in Thailand and recently moved back to Iceland to attend University. I took IGCSE and started A-Levels in Thailand, but later left and then took Preliminary studies at Reykjavík University before entering Computer Science Undergraduate program. 

Most of my employments were just basic things such as Shop Keeping, fast food restaurants and small factory work. Last summer I got a small programming job for the summer where I worked on the company's website and server-side integrations for their software. Tools used were Gatsby (React) and NodeJS.

As of right now my favorite programming language is JavaScript. I have mostly just worked/played with web applications rather than desktop or mobile applications, but I am always willing to do more.

My expectation from this course is to have a stronger understanding and experience about Continuous Delivery process as I believe it is a vital tool to use in the Industry. The last course (Hugbúnaðarfræði) I got exposed to the process and really liked how it applies to scale of projects and how useful it is.

Born and raised in Iceland with the exception of three years where my family and i moved to Denmark where my stepdad attended Aarhus University. I started studying to become an electrician but i quickly realized that my intrest was elsewhere and went on to study at Frumgreinadeildinn here in Reykjavík University before entering the Computer Science program.

My entire working career has been at Olíudreifing and right now i work as a technician and handle the computer side of things when gas pumps or Sjálfsalar when something goes wrong. Unfortunately i dont get to do alot of programming but im hoping that changes as the job grows as we are getting more and more responsibility from the companies we service.

I chose this three week course mainly because of the las project in Hugbúnaðarfræði as it gave an insight to how things are done in the workplace and i really liked how the test driven aspect of the work really made things easier for the team to work together and be sure that when you make changes to the code or add functionality you can be sure that it doesn't break something else in the process.
