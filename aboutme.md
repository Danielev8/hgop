# About Us

## Daníel Ekaphan Valberg

I was born in Iceland but most of my life I grew up in Thailand and recently moved back to Iceland to attend University. I took IGCSE and started A-Levels in Thailand, but later left and then took Preliminary studies at Reykjavík University before entering Computer Science Undergraduate program. 

Most of my employments were just basic things such as Shop Keeping, fast food restaurants and small factory work. Last summer I got a small programming job for the summer where I worked on the company's website and server-side integrations for their software. Tools used were Gatsby (React) and NodeJS.

As of right now my favorite programming language is JavaScript. I have mostly just worked/played with web applications rather than desktop or mobile applications, but I am always willing to do more.

My expectation from this course is to have a stronger understanding and experience about Continuous Delivery process as I believe it is a vital tool to use in the Industry. The last course (Hugbúnaðarfræði) I got exposed to the process and really liked how it applies to scale of projects and how useful it is.
